# SimpleNetwork
SimpleNetwork is a small boilerplate package containing code to make a network calls
It supports all network methods, etags, and custom body.

This library is open source, but it’s for personal use only. I don’t intend to give it much support past any needs that I might have, use it at your own risk.
